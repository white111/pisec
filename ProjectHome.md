Customizable hardware security daemon written for Raspberry Pi in C++. Only few variables to edit. System can be armed/disarmed by specified inputs. Input state different then normal during Arm state means violation and results in activating defined outputs and additional scripts(SMS, email, photo). Any number of GPIO pins can be defined input as or output ( GPIO version).

C++ daemon 2way communication with PHP via shared memory.

Suggestions very much welcome.
